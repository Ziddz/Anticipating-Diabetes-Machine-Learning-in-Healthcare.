# Anticipating-Diabetes-Machine-Learning-in-Healthcare.
The project aims to create a diabetes-predicting model using data analysis and machine learning techniques, enabling early intervention and improved patient outcomes.
* The project focuses on developing a diabetes-predicting model using data analysis and machine learning techniques.
* By analyzing patterns and linkages within the dataset, the model aims to forecast the presence of diabetes.
* Early identification of individuals at risk can lead to timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
* The dataset used in the project consists of 96,128 distinct rows and 9 columns.
* Exploratory data analysis techniques, such as histograms and count plots, were employed to gain insights into the dataset.
* Data preparation involved simplifying the smoking history column and encoding categorical data for machine learning.
* Correlation analysis was performed to understand the relationships between variables and their influence on predicting diabetes.
* The Random Forest Classifier method was used for model building, with hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV.
* The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to address class imbalance in the dataset.
* Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with a confusion matrix.
* The study highlights the potential of the developed model in early identification and intervention for diabetes, improving patient outcomes and reducing comorbidities.
